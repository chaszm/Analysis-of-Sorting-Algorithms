# Optimal Sorting Algorithms for Varying Datasets

Different common sorting algorithms were implemented and tested with datasets of varying sizes.
These include:
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Radix Sort
Heap Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort


# Introduction and Project Overview

Sorting algorithms are an integral part of computer science with many real world applications. Our group was drawn to this topic because we know just how important learning how to utilize these algorithms is for our future jobs. These types of algorithms allow programmers to simplify complex problems, organize large data sets, and improve the efficiency of any program. By mastering sorting algorithms, programmers gain the ability to tackle intricate problems and overall enhance the efficiency and performance of their programs. Real world examples of these algorithms are seen within our everyday lives with Google Search or in E-Commerce stores.  This shows just how relevant this topic is in the field of computer science. 

Our project, Optimal Sorting Algorithms for Varying Datasets, had us focusing on analyzing six different sorting algorithms. The sorting algorithms that we chose to implement during this project were Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. We decided on these six algorithms because they are very commonly used within the field of computer science. Throughout our project, we focused on fully understanding each algorithm, how they perform, when we should implement them, and how they compare to each other. Through trial and error we managed to come up with a strategy to accurately record the data from each algorithm in order to compare them to one another. In the end, we accurately implemented, analyzed, and compared each of our algorithms through the data that we compiled.
